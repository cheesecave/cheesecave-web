**Authentication:** Optional (required for private repos)

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit`: Max commits to return (default: 20, max: 100)
- `after`: Pagination cursor (commit ID to start after)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "commits": [
    {
      "id": "abc123def456...",

## Get Commit Diff

**Pattern:** `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{namespace}/{name}/commit/{commit_id}/diff`

**Authentication:** Optional (required for private repos)

**Purpose:** Show what changed in this commit compared to parent

**Response:**
```json
{
  "commit_id": "abc123def456...",
  "parent_commit": "parent_commit_id",
  "message": "Update model weights",
  "author": "alice",
  "date": 1737360932,
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "model.safetensors",
      "type": "changed",
      "path_type": "object",
      "size_bytes": 5368709120,
      "is_lfs": true,
      "sha256": "new_sha256",
      "previous_sha256": "old_sha256",
      "previous_size": 5368000000,
      "diff": null
    },
    {
      "path": "config.json",
      "type": "changed",
      "path_type": "object",
      "size_bytes": 512,
      "is_lfs": false,
      "sha256": "abc123",
      "previous_sha256": "def456",
      "diff": "@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n {\n-  \"model\": \"bert\"\n+  \"model\": \"bert-v2\"\n }"
    },
    {
      "path": "new_file.txt",
      "type": "added",
      "path_type": "object",
      "size_bytes": 100,
      "is_lfs": false,
      "sha256": "xyz789",
      "diff": "@@ -0,0 +1,1 @@\n+Hello world"
    },
    {
      "path": "old_file.txt",
      "type": "removed",
      "path_type": "object",
      "size_bytes": 50,
      "is_lfs": false,
      "previous_sha256": "old_hash",
      "diff": "@@ -1,1 +0,0 @@\n-Goodbye"
    }
  ]
}
```

**File Change Types:**
- `"added"`: New file in this commit
- `"removed"`: File deleted in this commit
- `"changed"`: File modified in this commit

**Diff Field:**
- `null`: For LFS files or files >1MB
- Unified diff format: For text files <1MB

**LFS Detection:**
- Checked from database File record
- Falls back to repo-specific LFS rules

**Example:**
```bash
GET /api/models/username/my-model/commit/abc123/diff
```

**Processing:**
- All file changes fetched from LakeFS diff API
- Diff generated in parallel for all non-LFS files
- SHA256 values from database (accurate for LFS files)
- Size limits: Skip diff for files >1MB

## Revert and Reset Availability

KohakuHub-only endpoints that tell whether a commit can be reverted, or a
branch reset to it, before trying. They are separate from the Hugging Face
compatible commit list on purpose: that payload stays what
`huggingface_hub` expects, and clients paging through a history never pay
for these checks.

Every verdict is `{"available": true | false | null, "reason", "message"}`.
`reason` is one of:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `disabled` | The operation is switched off on this site |
| `forbidden` | The user has no write access to the repository |
| `initial_commit` | Revert: the repository's first commit has nothing to revert |
| `conflict` | Revert: later commits changed the same files (`conflicts` lists them) |
| `no_changes` | No file's content would change (already undone, or the branch already has this content). LakeFS then refuses a revert, or records an empty commit |
| `lfs_missing` | LFS objects it would restore are garbage collected or gone from storage (`missing_lfs`; a revert also lists any `conflicts`). Reported before a conflict |
| `already_current` | Reset: the branch is at this commit |

### One commit (exact)

**Pattern:** `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{namespace}/{name}/commit/{commit_id}/operations?branch=main`

Decides exactly, from LakeFS and the bucket: for revert, LakeFS's three-way
rule per path the commit changed (the branch still at the commit's version
is undone, already at the parent's is left alone, anything else is a
conflict); for reset, a two-dot diff between the branch head and the
commit. Available verdicts carry `files` (how many files change); reset
verdicts carry `requires_force` (the reset endpoint requires `force` for
`main`).

```json
{
  "commit": "8a4f…", "branch": "main", "head": "c01d…",
  "can_write": true, "operations": {"revert": true, "reset": true},
  "parents": ["77be…"],
  "revert": {"available": false, "reason": "conflict",
             "message": "Later commits changed the same files: weights.bin.",
             "conflicts": ["weights.bin"]},
  "reset": {"available": true, "files": 3, "requires_force": true}
}
```

### A commit list page (only what is proven)

**Pattern:** `POST /api/{repo_type}s/{namespace}/{name}/commits/{branch}/operations`

Body: `{"commit_ids": [...]}`, at most 100. Returns
`{"branch", "head", "can_write", "operations", "commits": {id: {"revert", "reset"}}}`.
Only what is proven unavailable at bounded cost is reported; everything else
is `{"available": null}` (unknown, never "available"): the initial commit
cannot be reverted, the head needs no reset, and LFS objects are only looked
for when the repository's history references garbage-collected ones.
Conflicts need the exact check. Nothing is evaluated for users without write
access or when both operations are off (`commits` is empty).

## Files No Longer Stored

LFS objects garbage collection removed (see
[LFS garbage collection](../features/core/lfs.md#garbage-collection)) are
known up front, for every reader.

### A commit's whole tree

**Pattern:** `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{namespace}/{name}/commit/{commit_id}/unavailable-files?branch=main`

Every LFS file of the commit's tree whose object was garbage collected:
`{"commit", "branch", "files": [{"path", "sha256"}]}`. Garbage collection
never removes an object the branch head claimed, so this reads one diff
(the paths differing from the head), the tombstones, and the objects the
head links that are tombstoned anyway (a revert, merge or reset can link an
object without claiming it). It never asks the bucket, and makes a bounded
number of LakeFS calls: `files` is `null` (`"reason": "too_large"`) past
that.

### The files a commit changed

`GET .../commit/{commit_id}/diff` marks each LFS file with `lfs_status`
(the commit's version) and `previous_lfs_status` (the version before it):
`available`, `collected` (garbage collected), `missing` (gone from storage)
or `unknown` (a large commit, where the bucket is only asked about a bounded
number of objects, or the bucket could not be reached).

### A commit list page

**Pattern:** `POST /api/{repo_type}s/{namespace}/{name}/commits/unavailable-files`

Body: `{"commit_ids": [...]}`, at most 100. Returns
`{"commits": {id: [paths]}}`: the LFS files each commit committed (added,
changed, restored, or re-committed unchanged) whose object garbage
collection removed. One database query, whatever the history's
length; files a commit only inherited are listed on its commit page.

## Usage Examples

### View Recent Commits

```python
import requests

API_BASE = "http://localhost:28080/api"
TOKEN = "your_token"

# Get last 50 commits
response = requests.get(
    f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commits/main?limit=50",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}
)

commits = response.json()["commits"]

for commit in commits:
    print(f"{commit['id'][:8]} - {commit['title']} by {commit['author']}")
```

---

### Paginate Through All Commits

```python
all_commits = []
after = None

while True:
    url = f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commits/main?limit=100"
    if after:
        url += f"&after={after}"

    response = requests.get(url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"})
    data = response.json()

    all_commits.extend(data["commits"])

    if not data["hasMore"]:
        break

    after = data["nextCursor"]

print(f"Total commits: {len(all_commits)}")
```

---

### View Commit Details with Diff

```python
commit_id = "abc123def456"

# Get commit info
commit_resp = requests.get(
    f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commit/{commit_id}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}
)
commit = commit_resp.json()

# Get diff
diff_resp = requests.get(
    f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commit/{commit_id}/diff",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}
)
diff = diff_resp.json()

print(f"Commit: {commit['title']}")
print(f"Author: {commit['author']}")
print(f"Date: {commit['date']}")
print(f"\nFiles changed: {len(diff['files'])}")

for file in diff['files']:
    print(f"\n{file['type'].upper()}: {file['path']}")
    if file.get('diff'):
        print(file['diff'])
    elif file.get('is_lfs'):
        print(f"  LFS file: {file['size_bytes']:,} bytes")
```

---

### Find Commits by Author

```python
# Get all commits
response = requests.get(
    f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commits/main?limit=100",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}
)

commits = response.json()["commits"]

# Filter by author
alice_commits = [c for c in commits if c["author"] == "alice"]

print(f"Alice made {len(alice_commits)} commits")
```

---

### Compare Two Commits

```python
def get_files_in_commit(commit_id):
    """Get list of files changed in commit"""
    diff_resp = requests.get(
        f"{API_BASE}/models/username/my-model/commit/{commit_id}/diff",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}
    )
    return {f["path"]: f for f in diff_resp.json()["files"]}

# Compare two commits
commit1_files = get_files_in_commit("commit1_id")
commit2_files = get_files_in_commit("commit2_id")

# Find common files
common_files = set(commit1_files.keys()) & set(commit2_files.keys())

print(f"Both commits changed {len(common_files)} files:")
for path in common_files:
    print(f"  {path}")
```

---

## Response Details

### Commit Object

From database (when available):
- `author`: Actual username from User table
- `user_id`: Database user ID
- `description`: Commit description field
- `committed_at`: ISO timestamp

From LakeFS (fallback):
- `author`: Committer field from LakeFS
- `metadata`: LakeFS metadata
- `date`: Unix timestamp

### Diff Format

**Unified Diff (for text files):**
```
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 {
-  "model": "bert"
+  "model": "bert-v2"
 }
```

**Format:**
- `@@` header: line numbers
- `-` lines: Removed
- `+` lines: Added
- ` ` lines: Context (unchanged)

**LFS Files:**
- No diff generated (too large)
- `diff: null`
- SHA256 hashes provided instead

---

## Performance Notes

**Commit List:**
- Fast (index-based pagination)
- Database join for author info
- Default limit: 20 commits

**Commit Diff:**
- Parallel file processing
- Diff generation for non-LFS files only
- Size limit: Skip diff for files >1MB
- Memory efficient (streaming)

**Best Practices:**
- Use pagination for large histories
- Cache commit lists client-side
- Limit diff viewing to recent commits
- Use commit IDs (not branch names) for stable refs
